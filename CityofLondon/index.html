<h2>A Brief History</h2>
<img src="Images/neighbourhood.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="neighbourhood"/>
<p>London is a city in Southwestern Ontario, Canada along the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. The city had a population of 383,822 according to the 2016 Canadian census. London is at the confluence of the Thames River, approximately 200 km (120 mi) from both Toronto and Detroit; and about 230 km (140 mi) from Buffalo, New York. The city of London is a separated municipality, politically separate from Middlesex County, though it remains the county seat. 
London and the Thames were named in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe, who proposed the site for the capital city of Upper Canada. The first European settlement was between 1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman.[4] The village was founded in 1826 and incorporated in 1855. Since then, London has grown to be the largest Southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada's 11th largest metropolitan area, having annexed many of the smaller communities that surrounded it.
London is a regional centre of healthcare and education, being home to the University of Western Ontario (which brands itself "Western University"), Fanshawe College, and several hospitals (including a University Hospital). The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centred on education, medical research, insurance, and information technology. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of Highway 401 and 402, connecting it to Toronto, Windsor and Sarnia. It also has an international airport, train, and bus station. </p>

<p>London is a must visit destination for culture and entertainment. We encourage you to experience a city that loves to laugh and live - a city where you’ll find extraordinary hidden history, pristine natural conservation areas, spectacular parkland, renowned entertainment, and a culture of its own! Enjoy a variety of experiences unmatched in Southwestern Ontario. Culture and entertainment tourism represents the greatest opportunity for London to grow as a destination. Venues, events, attractions and festivals large and small are an integral part of London’s image, culture, reputation, economic prosperity, fun and cultural vitality.Tourism London works closely with private and public sector partners to develop London as a culture and entertainment destination and increase visitation. London’s Culture and Entertainment Department led the bid and hosting responsibly of 2016 CCMA Awards.  The tremendous success of this event led to an opportunity to host the first ever 2017 Country Music Association of Ontario Awards and was the impetus for Tourism London submitting a bid for consideration to host a future JUNO Awards in London. London has a rich musical history. Guy Lombardo, the internationally-acclaimed Big-Band leader, was born in London, as was jazz-musician Rob McConnell, country-music legend Tommy Hunter, singer-songwriter Meaghan Smith, pop-icon Justin Bieber, and DJ-duo Loud Luxury; it is also the adopted home-town of hip-hop artist Shad Kabango, rock-music producer Jack Richardson, and 1960s folk-funk band Motherlode.· American country-music icon Johnny Cash proposed to his wife June Carter Cash onstage at the London Gardens.</p>
